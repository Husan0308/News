       name: "I’m unconvinced that he fits the profile. Here’s why. Joe’s favorite son was Beau, who died at the age of 46. Hunter is the classic wayward second son, the playboy prince, whose education was neglected for another. Joe’s favor fell to the darling elder son, whom he believed was destined for greatness. When that golden boy was tragically laid low before his time, the second son, who was never meant for much, had to fill his massive shoes. In a good fairy tale, the younger son rises to the occasion. Hunter, however, has failed to live up to Beau’s intended legacy.",

        name: "As the world grows increasingly unstable, leadership from the US is noticeably lacking. The so-called global hegemon seems unable to exert pressure even on states with which it has close relations, like Israel. The upcoming US presidential election adds a layer of uncertainty; the fact that one of the two possible winners is Donald Trump adds another layer. When the US is unpredictable, global volatility deepens as other states seek to craft their own solutions. The US must take a new approach on its foreign policy if it wishes to remain the primary world power and ensure a stable international system.",

In recent months, US presidential candidates Donald Trump, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have made prime content. For a candidate to win TikTok’s favor means a shot at winning over the youth vote. To do this, they must understand how young people make political content — and how political content makes young people.",

In fact, his connections to the infamous Office of Crime faction, headed by militiaman Adriano da Nóbrega, are still under investigation. It is also no secret that Bolsonaro was a staunch supporter of violent militia. In a speech to the National Congress in 2003, he defended the idea that “death squads” were a perfect solution for Rio de Janeiro’s public security crisis. He had consistently used his position as a politician to support death squads and distributed medals and jobs among well-known militia members, especially from Rio.",

Some even revel in their notoriety as exponents of “illiberal democracy” (e.g., Hungarian President Viktor Orbàn).     Some democracy-abusers in the US are so extreme that they openly support a hostile foreign state (Russia), which Representative Michael R. Turner suggests repudiates their oath of allegiance. Critics have also censured the ultra-conservative media celebrity Tucker Carlson for his openly pro-Vladimir Putin stance.',
